# Agenda for Day 2

1. Read/ run through [introMath](../Day2/introMath.ipynb) in Day2 (built based on feedback from Day 1)
2. Finish the [IntroJupyter](../Day1/IntroJupyter.ipynb) and [inClassQuiz](../Day1/inClassQuiz.ipynb) notebooks from Day 1.
<br>Related tidbit: Don't worry if you are moving faster or slower than other people in the class; know that you are earning points for your effort and progress with respect to your prior experience.  If you are moving faster than others, you are probably a more experienced programmer, and you will be able to move on to more advanced material sooner.  If you are moving slower than others, you are probably a less experienced programmer (not a bad thing!), and you have the opportunity to spend more time on the basics. Either way, just make sure you are actively putting in the effort to actively learn new material, regardless of what level of prior experience you have. You only lose points if you are not actively trying to continuously expand your knowledge using the resources provided for the 55 minutes you are ~~stuck in class~~ engaged in daily educational opportunities each day of this workshop.
3. Read/ run through [basicPlotting](../Day2/basicPlotting.ipynb) in Day2
4. Take the simulation defined in the Day1 `inClassQuiz` and plot the `position` and `velocity` values with respect to time. Bonus points if you can get them both in the same plot.
5. Read/ run through [interactivePlotting](../Day2/interactivePlotting.ipynb) in Day2
6. Hi Eric
7. Make the plot you created in step 5 interactive, making the gravity and initial horizontal/ vertical velocity vector components sliders that can be adjusted to see how the plot changes. Make sure you also plot the original graph as a reference.
8. Start researching publicly available datasets related to the area of physics you are interested in. Email me some links to datasets you find interesting. I will try to find some time to go over some of them in class and incorporate some of them into the workshop examples/ projects.
